## Starting with the Basics

Every great builder begins with a strong foundation. For front-end development, your foundation lies in mastering a few critical skills.

### 1\. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

#### **What is it?**

HTML is the structure of your website. Imagine building a house; HTML would be its bricks and beams.

#### **Why learn it?**

Every web page starts with HTML. Knowing it inside and out is your first step in web development.

#### **How to learn?**

* Begin by understanding the importance of tags and how to use them.
    
* Practice creating lists, forming links, and embedding images.
    
* Dive deeper to understand forms, and more about semantic HTML which ensures your site is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.

### **2\. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

#### **What is it?**

CSS is the design of your website. Going back to the house analogy, CSS would be the paint, wallpaper, and decorations.

#### **Why learn it?**

Without CSS, websites would be plain and unexciting. CSS adds flair and personality.

#### **How to learn?**

* Begin with the basics of colors, fonts, and margins.

### **3\. JavaScript**

#### **What is it?**

JavaScript brings your website to life. It allows for interactions, animations, and much more.
