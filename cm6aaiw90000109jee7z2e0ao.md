*Please keep in mind that what I’m sharing here is based on my personal thoughts, observations, and research. I’m not an AI expert or scientist, but these are the questions and ideas that have been on my mind. Also, I have personally been using various AI tools for couple of years. I treat AI as my assistant or “servant” to help me with tasks I already know how to do, so that I remain in control, not the other way around.*

# Before I Start

Hey everyone! I have been thinking a lot lately about how AI (Artificial Intelligence) is quickly becoming part of almost every aspect of our lives. From the moment we wake up to the time we go to bed, there is some form of AI helping us with everything: be it voice assistants, recommendation systems, or automated tools.

But while AI seems to make life easier, there is a **dark side** we often overlook. Can we become too dependent on AI? Will we stop using our own logic or common sense for even the most basic tasks?

In this blog, we will explore the potential **dark side** of AI, delving into concerns about our reliance on these systems, the hidden costs of “free” or ”affordable subscriptions” of AI services, and the implications of a future where AI becomes as vital to our existence as oxygen. Finally, we’ll discuss the importance of keeping AI as a servant to humanity rather than humanity becoming subservient to AI.

### 1\. AI as the “New Oxygen”

It might sound dramatic, but I sometimes imagine AI becoming as important to us as oxygen. Think about it: without internet or smart devices, we already feel disconnected. What if AI becomes so critical that losing access to it makes it impossible to function in society? The more we rely on AI, the less we train our own brains to do things like problem-solving or critical thinking. Eventually, we may not **think for ourselves** at all.

### 2\. The True Cost of “Free” or “Low Cost Subscriptions” AI

We’ve all heard it before: **“If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.”** Most AI services collect and use our data to train their models. Right now, many are free or offered at low cost to attract users and gather as much data as possible. But down the road, as these tools become more sophisticated and essential, they might hike up their prices or introduce subscription models that not everyone can afford.

If AI becomes a necessity, then being blocked or locked out of AI platforms could be devastating like cutting off someone’s internet connection, but potentially much worse.

### 3\. Widening the Gap

If advanced AI tools become expensive or exclusive, those who can pay for top-tier AI will have a major advantage. They will have better recommendations, smarter data analysis, and more efficient workflows. Meanwhile, those without access will struggle to keep up. This new digital divide could be even larger than the current one, creating two separate worlds: the **AI-privileged** and the **AI-deprived.**

### 4\. My Experience with AI Tools

I’ve been using different AI tools for the last couple of years, and let me be clear: **I use them as my assistants or “slaves”** for tasks I already know how to handle. Whether its drafting quick outlines, debugging code, creating content, brainstorming ideas, or summarizing complex topics. I don’t hand over my entire workflow to AI. Instead, I make sure **I** understand the process from start to finish, and then let AI speed things up. I believe this approach keeps me in control and ensures my skills remain sharp, rather than letting AI do all the thinking for me.

### 5\. Avoiding Slavery (But Not Ours!)

There is this unsettling possibility: if we’re not careful, we might end up serving AI instead of having AI serve us. That sounds futuristic and dramatic, but its worth considering. We should ensure AI tools stay **under human control** and remain helpers that support us rather than direct us.

* **Human-Centered Design**: Build AI to **enhance** our skills, not replace them.
    
* **Regulation and Transparency**: Demand clarity on how AI models use our data, and push for ethical guidelines.
    
* **Stay Educated**: Understand the basics of AI, even if you’re not a tech expert, so you’re aware of the risks.
    

### 6\. A Few References & Resources

* ***Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence* by Max Tegmark**  
    This book delves into how AI might reshape society, work, and even our sense of what it means to be human.
    
* ***Weapons of Math Destruction* by Cathy O’Neil**  
    Explores the dangers of opaque AI algorithms and how they can unintentionally (or sometimes intentionally) increase bias and inequality.

# Final Thoughts

I’m not here to tell anyone to stop using AI. Far from it! AI has already brought huge benefits, from medical breakthroughs to streamlining our work. But we **should** pay attention to how dependent we become. If we don’t stay aware, we might accidentally hand over too much power to these systems and the companies behind them.

Let’s keep using AI as a tool but let’s **remain the ones in charge**. After all, its our creativity, logic, and curiosity that drove us to create AI in the first place. Let’s not lose those very qualities by getting too comfortable with letting machines think for us.
