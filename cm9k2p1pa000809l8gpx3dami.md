# Introduction

We have all seen how fast AI is evolving. From code generation to scaffolding entire modules, tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and others are already part of many engineers daily routines. But one approach that stands out and is rapidly gaining traction is something I refer to as **Vibe Coding**.

In this blog, I want to share my perspective as a software engineer with over **13 years of experience** building real-world applications, helping teams, and adopting emerging technologies. I will explain what vibe coding is, how it's evolving, and why I believe it's the kind of shift software engineers must pay attention to if they want to stay productive, relevant, and ahead.

# What is Vibe Coding?

In simple words, vibe coding is a conversational way of building software using AI tools. Instead of typing all the code yourself, you talk to an intelligent assistant, explain what you want, and guide it step-by-step as it writes code for you.

It is not just asking for one-off code snippets. It is about having a flow where you collaborate with AI, adjust the outputs, and build something meaningful together. You are basically working like a team lead guiding a junior engineer, but that engineer happens to be an AI model.

## Why Vibe Coding is the Future (At Least for Now)

Like every new technology, vibe coding has its rough edges. There are moments when tools lose context, repeat actions, or even fail to understand basic logic. But this is temporary. These tools are evolving fast and learning from their mistakes.

Right now, pricing might be a concern for some, but as competition grows, tools will become more affordable and more refined. The current versions might not be perfect, but the direction is clear that vibe coding is going to mature and become part of how problem solvers build solutions.

## Can Non-Technical People Use Vibe Coding?

Yes, to an extent. Vibe coding is very powerful for quick **prototypes** or **MVPs**. Non-technical users can create simple apps, landing pages, and even automate some workflows with tools like:

* Cursor
    
* Gemini
    
* Replit Ghostwriter
    
* Amazon CodeWhisperer
    
* Codeium
    
* Copilot Labs
    

But when it comes to full production-ready systems, non-technical users face clear limitations. They often lack knowledge in areas like:

* Security principles
    
* Performance optimization
    
* UI/UX patterns
    
* Application scalability
    
* Data management and architecture
    
* and many more
    

So yes, vibe coding can help bring ideas to life quickly. But building and scaling reliable software still requires the skill of a software engineer who understands systems deeply.

# Why Software Engineers Should Embrace Vibe Coding

If you write code for a living, vibe coding is not a shortcut, it is a force multiplier. I have personally delivered work that would usually take weeks, in just a few hours, simply by working smart and using AI tools effectively.

When you already know what you are doing, vibe coding becomes a way to delegate the boring or repetitive tasks. You are still in control of the logic, the architecture, the design decisions, you are just working faster.

It feels like you are guiding a capable assistant who needs direction but can execute quickly. This makes your time more valuable and your output sharper.

## What Needs Improvement in Vibe Coding Tools

Like any early technology, current tools need improvements. Some of the limitations I have personally experienced include:

* Losing context after a few messages
    
* Repeating parts of the code or adding unnecessary steps
    
* Struggling with complex logic building
    
* Ignoring or skipping edge cases
    

Hereâ€™s how I work around it:

* I break requests into clear, focused steps
    
* I give detailed instructions and avoid vague prompts
    
* I use tools that support memory or persistent threads (like Cursor or Replit)
    
* Properly providing the basics and major requirements of the project or work
    
* I define set of rules early on, such as "use Tailwind CSS" or "do not use Redux"
    

With a bit of structure and habit, you can still build high-quality software using vibe coding, even with its current limitations.

## Tips for Non-Technical and Technical People

### If You Are Non-Technical:

* Start with small ideas and MVPs
    
* Learn a bit about how software works so you can ask better questions
    
* Use tools that offer guardrails and templates
    
* Always test what you build before using it seriously
    

### If You Are a Software Engineer:

* Learn how to write good prompts
    
* Use vibe coding to skip boilerplate, generate tests, and handle basic flows
    
* Review every output and maintain code quality
    
* Stay updated on new tools and features

# Final Thoughts

AI is not going to replace software engineers. But those who do not learn how to work with AI tools might get replaced by those who do.

Vibe coding is not magic. It is a practical, evolving method of building software in collaboration with AI. It makes your process faster, cleaner, and more scalable, if you know how to guide it.

In 2025, if you are still writing every function from scratch, you are not being efficient. You do not need to rely completely on AI, but you must learn how to work with it.

Vibe coding is not the end of traditional development. It is simply the beginning of a smarter way to build software.
